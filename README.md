# Assignment 1 - Java RPG Characters

This assignment is about implementing the basic functions of an RPG game. 

The functions include: 
- character creation 
- four different character classes
- item creation for weapons and armor
- a 3-point stat attribute system that is universal for all classes
- each class has it's own main stat attribute that contribute to damage
- level up system
- item also have stats that contribute to the character's damage

This was my first "bigger" project written in JAVA. So I couldn't get some of the desired functions to be implemented.
I couldn't get the created characters to equip created items or interact with said items.

However character creation is possible with leveling up. And creating items is also possible.

Even though I couldn't get all the interaction between characters and items to work, 
I'm overall impressed and proud of what I accomplished.

Peace,

Phillip Friis Petersen
